# How Build The Earth Works

## How we are building the earth

First off, the project uses two essential mods:

* TerraPlusPlus: uses public datasets to create a 1:1 scale of the planet in Minecraft
* CubicChunks: modifies the way chunks work which makes us able to build to an infinite height

Additionally, we also created a map to limit distortion called the Dymaxion Map Projection: (each color band adds 0.1 meters of distortion)

With this, we use a variety of online tools such as:

* Google Maps: used to find the coordinate position of everything on Earth.
* Google Streetview: used to view 360Â° images of the Earth.
* Google Earth: used to find the height/altitude of things like buildings or mountains.

Along with these we also use many country or region-specific map services.

## Build Teams

There are two different types of build teams:

* Regional build teams: aims to build the entirety of one or more countries.
* Non-regional build teams: builds in places all over the world

Each build team is its community of builders and staff, many of which have Discord and Minecraft servers.

Here is a [map of all build team regions](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=114VY4uNAIJ0cEuiOagkJgpFYaT26vw0E&ll=44.12616853498514%2C28.93616442206138&z=3):

## Discord

All communication between builders, staff, admins, etc. happens through Discord.

The official Build The Earth Discord server is a place for big announcements, highlights, support, and general or off-topic discussion between all members or non-members of the project.

Each build team also have their own Discord server where members of the same nationality can come together and discuss, host events, host build competitions and so on.
