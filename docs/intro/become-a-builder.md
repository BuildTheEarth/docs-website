You can read about the three different application types below.

## Downloading the mod pack

If your team uses 1.12.2, it's reccomended you download the modpack.

## Application systems

There are a few different application systems used by different build teams.

Don't worry, you don't need to be a building grandmaster to join the project. 

After doing it a couple of times you get the hang of it, the first build will always be the hardest.

## Trial system

The trial system involves building on a build team server. You first get a trial role that grants you access to build in a confined area. Then you build 1 or 2 buildings to use in your application.

It generally works like this:

1. Join the Discord server of the team you want to join. [Here is a map of all teams](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=114VY4uNAIJ0cEuiOagkJgpFYaT26vw0E&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C73.98213445019763&z=2)
2. Get the trial role on your Minecraft account, either by getting it on Discord and linking your Discord and Minecraft account, or sending a ticket.You should try to look for a "become builder" channel.
3. Go on their Minecarft server (ip should be on their Discord somewhere). Then go to the trial zone, usually by doing /trial or /warp (something).
4. Build 1 or 2 buldings (depends on team) using the buildings guidebook.
5. Take pictures of the building/buildings in Minecraft by pressing F2. Then upload them to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) to get a link for the pictures.
6. Take pictures of the building/buildings in real life. Some teams will want streetview images, some will want Google Earth images, some will want the google link, and some will want the coordinates. You can upload these to the same imgur.com post.
7. Fill out the application for your build team. This is usually done on the team's Discord or on [the website](https://buildtheearth.net/buildteams)
