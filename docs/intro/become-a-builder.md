## Building your first build

### Joining "The BTE world"

To build the earth in Minecraft, we have created a special world that is a 1:1 scale of the earth.

In this tutorial, you will be going into a singleplayer BTE world where you are going to be building two buildings of your choice, that you can use in the application to a build team.

Here is how you can go into this world:

1. Launch Minecraft with the BTE mod pack selected.

2. Click `Singleplayer`

3. Join the world called `Build The Earth (new projection)`

### Teleporting with TPLL

Now that you are in the BTE world, it's time to learn how to explore it.

To travel to different places in the world we will use the TPLL command. This command takes real-world coordinates and using some mathematical equations converts this to the corresponding location in the BTE world, and then teleports you there.

Here is how you use it:

1. Without shutting down Minecraft, open Google Maps by clicking [here](https://www.google.com/maps)
2. Use the search bar (write in an address/location and press enter) to find a place to teleport to. (Doesn't need to be the place you want to build, we will go over that later)

    ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1096118472909533368/1121212261906780293/googlemapssearch.png?width=1709&height=905)
3. Navigate the map by dragging and scrolling
4. After navigating to your location, right click a spesific spot where you will teleport to.

5. Left click the coordinates in the first row in the pop-up.

6. In Minecraft, write "/tpll" then press `CTRL + V` to paste the coordinates, then press `Enter`

7. After waiting for a bit, you will be teleported to our location! Remember that this is your private survival world, and you will not find any buildings (unless you build them of course :D).

### Choosing a building to build

When making your first build, it's important to pick something simple.

For a building to be easy to make, it should be:

* Located in a somewhat big city where Google Maps 3D data is available. [Click here to find out which cities have 3D](https://list.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_3D_locations_in_Google_Earth)
* Not so big, but very square. Suburban buildings are often good example of this.
* Visible from Google Streetview
* Not full of small details.
* A straight roof

Here are some good examples from around the world:
* Aalborg, Denmark
    ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1096118472909533368/1121568813201240115/denmarkexample.png?width=1786&height=905)
* Rouen, France
    ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1096118472909533368/1121568869333614713/franceexample.png?width=1797&height=905)
* Houston, Texas, USA
    ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1096118472909533368/1121568843123396669/usaexample.png?width=1795&height=905)
* Buenos Aries, Argentina
    ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1096118472909533368/1121568812639211560/argentinaexample.png?width=1795&height=905)

You will have to find two buildings to build.

### Making the building outline

Now that you have found your two buildings, let's start making them in Minecraft!

The first step to making any building is building the building footprint, or what we call the outline. By making this first, we can extend these into walls and then make a roof on top.

If you have watched some of PippenFTS' old videos you might wonder "why not just use the brick outline?". In later times we found out that the brick outlines are not accurate, and therefore we make our own.

Here is how you do it:

Note: In this tutorial, we will just use a building in Bergen as an example. The process to make a building is the same for whatever building you choose, so follow along as you are building your own.

1. In Google Maps, go to one of the building you want to build
2. Click on Layers in the bottom-left area of your map.

3. Click on More.

4. Click on Satellite and ensure that Globe View is checked.

5. Use the TPLL command you used above to teleport to each corner of the building, and make sure to place a block where you land in Minecraft.

6. In Minecraft, do the command `//wand`. This should give you a wooden axe
