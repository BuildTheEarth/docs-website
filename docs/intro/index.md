# How Build The Earth Works

## Our goal

Our aim is to build as much of the earth as possible on a 1:1 scale in Minecraft and to allow anyone in the world to explore this virtual recreation from the comfort of their own home.

We do not build the inside of private property, and do not necessarily set to build things that are not "attached" to the earth such as vehicles.

There is no estimate made of when it will be done, but it will probably be in a decade or more.

## How we are building the Earth

First off, the project uses two essential mods:

* TerraPlusPlus: uses public datasets to create a 1:1 scale of the planet in Minecraft
* CubicChunks: modifies the way chunks work which makes us able to build to an infinite height

Additionally, we also created a map to limit distortion called the Dymaxion Map Projection: (each color band adds 0.1 meters of distortion)

With this, we use a variety of online tools such as:

* Google Maps: used to find the coordinate position of everything on Earth.
* Google Streetview: used to view 360Â° images of the Earth.
* Google Earth: used to find the height/altitude of things like buildings or mountains.

We also use Youtube videos or pictures found online, in addition to many country or region-specific map services.

## Build Teams

Each region/country has a "team" dedicated to building it. This team manages the progress of that region or country and all progress is located on the team's server.

Teams offer a fun and supportive environment with people from your own country or region whom you can chat with or build with.

There are two different types of Build Teams:

* Regional Build Teams: aims to build the entirety of one or more countries.
* Non-regional Build Teams: builds in places all over the world

## Discord

All communication between builders, staff, admins, etc. happens through Discord.

The official Build The Earth Discord server is a place for big announcements, highlights, support, and general or off-topic discussion between all members or non-members of the project.

Each Build Team also has their own Discord server, where members of the same nationality can come together and discuss, host events, give support.
