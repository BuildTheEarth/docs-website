## Building your first build

### Joining "The BTE world"

To build the earth in Minecraft, we have created a special world that is a 1:1 scale of the earth.

In this tutorial, you will be going into a singleplayer BTE world where you are going to be building two buildings of your choice, that you can use in the application to a build team.

Here is how you can go into this world:

1. Launch Minecraft with the BTE mod pack selected.

Here is how you use it:
