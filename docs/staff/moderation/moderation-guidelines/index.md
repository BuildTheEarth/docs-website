# BTE Moderation Guidelines

## 1.0 PURPOSE 

This document is an above-all reference needed for moderating in BTE. Subjects addressed include team member conduct, handling difficult situations, moderation commands, moderations standards, and many other topics. We hope that this document will be of great use to you!

## 2.0 COMMUNITY OVERVIEW

It is important to remember that BuildTheEarth is a community project, unlike most other Discord servers. If you come from moderation on a traditional Discord server, while many of the skills are the same, one of the most important things you will need is knowledge of our project. It's essential that you read over the information channels and ask questions when you don't know the answer. Our server is an inclusive, non-discriminatory, and PG-13 server.

## 3.0 STAFF HIERARCHY

The complete Build The Earth staff structure can be found [here](https://app.milanote.com/1N4MYa15e6msad/bte-staff-organization-chart?p=sfH31jITyc6).

Our staff team works with a tiered hierarchy, but it is essential to remember that no staff is above another. It's simply a system of who has what permissions and who reports to whom.

#### Moderation Hierarchy

Trial Moderator → Moderator → Senior Moderator → Moderation Manager → Administrator

## 4.0 STAFF CONDUCT

Staff members act as the public face of BTE within the Discord. Frequently, members follow the implicit cues on how staff members communicate with the community and each other. It is your responsibility to maintain a certain amount of professionalism and decorum while still having fun. 

Try to be aware of your use of language and the tone of voice when addressing community members. Your job is to be of service to the community and it does not place you in a superior position to them. This project is meant for the community, and your behavior should represent that.

As a member of this team, you are a role model, and as such, it is vital that you act in accordance with this fact. Your conduct on the server should represent what we want our community to be. It is highly recommended that you read [this article](https://discord.com/moderation/4405230698519-110:-Moderator-Etiquette) from the Discord Moderator Academy. While it does not cover everything we expect from our moderators, it is helpful to start.

You will be working in a team while moderating on our server, and it's crucial that you are a team player. Everyone will make mistakes, and that's okay. However, it's important that once you realize that you made a mistake, it gets fixed and that you are willing to receive feedback. This is so we as a team can grow and learn from our mistakes.

As briefly mentioned earlier, it's vital that your conduct is representative of what our server represents. While your conduct outside of BTE is not ours to manage, anytime you are representing BTE, you must act according to how you would act within BTE. You are representing BTE anytime you associate yourself with BTE staff outside of BTE, such as on another Discord server.
