# BTE Moderation Guidelines

## 1.0 PURPOSE 

This document is an above-all reference needed for moderating in BTE. Subjects addressed include team member conduct, handling difficult situations, moderation commands, moderations standards, and many other topics. We hope that this document will be of great use to you!

## 2.0 COMMUNITY OVERVIEW

It is important to remember that BuildTheEarth is a community project, unlike most other Discord servers. If you come from moderation on a traditional Discord server, while many of the skills are the same, one of the most important things you will need is knowledge of our project. It's essential that you read over the information channels and ask questions when you don't know the answer. Our server is an inclusive, non-discriminatory, and PG-13 server.

## 3.0 STAFF HIERARCHY

The complete Build The Earth staff structure can be found [here](https://app.milanote.com/1N4MYa15e6msad/bte-staff-organization-chart?p=sfH31jITyc6).

Our staff team works with a tiered hierarchy, but it is essential to remember that no staff is above another. It's simply a system of who has what permissions and who reports to whom.

#### Moderation Hierarchy

Trial Moderator → Moderator → Senior Moderator → Moderation Manager → Administrator

## 4.0 STAFF CONDUCT

Staff members act as the public face of BTE within the Discord. Frequently, members follow the implicit cues on how staff members communicate with the community and each other. It is your responsibility to maintain a certain amount of professionalism and decorum while still having fun. 

Try to be aware of your use of language and the tone of voice when addressing community members. Your job is to be of service to the community and it does not place you in a superior position to them. This project is meant for the community, and your behavior should represent that.

As a member of this team, you are a role model, and as such, it is vital that you act in accordance with this fact. Your conduct on the server should represent what we want our community to be. It is highly recommended that you read [this article](https://discord.com/moderation/4405230698519-110:-Moderator-Etiquette) from the Discord Moderator Academy. While it does not cover everything we expect from our moderators, it is helpful to start.

You will be working in a team while moderating on our server, and it's crucial that you are a team player. Everyone will make mistakes, and that's okay. However, it's important that once you realize that you made a mistake, it gets fixed and that you are willing to receive feedback. This is so we as a team can grow and learn from our mistakes.

As briefly mentioned earlier, it's vital that your conduct is representative of what our server represents. While your conduct outside of BTE is not ours to manage, anytime you are representing BTE, you must act according to how you would act within BTE. You are representing BTE anytime you associate yourself with BTE staff outside of BTE, such as on another Discord server.

### 4.1 COMPLIANCE

Build The earth uses a strike system within the staff team read more about it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw).

### 5.2 DE-ESCALATION

The most important part of our job as moderators is defusing a situation before it becomes a problem. This is why it is vital to maintain a calm and professional attitude when handling conflicts but keep a very close eye on things. The absence of visual and auditory cues, in combination with invisibility, anonymity, and delayed reactions, can cause online conflict to escalate fast.

A Moderator should intervene if a member resorts to personally insulting another member, using language that breaches the community guidelines, or posts anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.

As the first course of action, a Moderator should remove the offensive content by removing the posts in question, and warnings or infractions may be necessary if our guidelines were breached.

### Dealing with Members Complaints

When a member makes a complaint about a member of staff, the community, or the brand; **it is a Moderator's responsibility to handle the complaint professionally.** This is for their protection and to protect the nature of the community. 

Complaints may be petty, abusive, exaggerated, or in some cases, completely false. Regardless of these above factors, it is important to resist the temptation to argue or outright refute the complaint. If a Moderator doesn't feel that they can remain neutral, the complaint should be redirected to another Moderator or escalated to the Moderation Manager.

Additionally, please do not feel compelled to immediately respond to any claims or complaints made by a user as a 'fire-fighting' measure, as it may just escalate the situation needlessly. Please forward the complaint if it is of a nature that involves the project or the staff team as a whole.

A Moderator who responds negatively to a complaint may have their privileges removed if BTE or the Moderation Manager determines that their comments are libelous or otherwise detrimental to the situation.

Any complaint process should begin with getting all the facts and making it clear that the complaint has been heard. This affords the complainant time to calm down if they are emotional. If possible, a realistic (achievable) timeline for following up should be offered.

Situations like these may end up requiring conversing within the team. Make a decision, and acknowledge any errors made, if necessary. Inform the complainant of the outcome. Follow up with any other parties involved.

When dealing with a complaint about your brand, it is important to respond at times. Being unresponsive generally incites (more) anger. A response that illustrates respect and understanding of the concerns will indicate your intention to rectify any problems. It is best to communicate that you intend to escalate the complaint to another member of the organization, in which case it is important to acknowledge receipt of the complaint and make the community member feel heard.
