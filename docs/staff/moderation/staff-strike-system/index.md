# Staff Strike System

This description is increasing in level of detail. If you just want to get a brief overview check you can just read the first chapter. The following chapters are increasingly specific.

## Brief overview

We have a fine grained system for different levels of staff infractions. The following list gives an approximate idea what the different tiers are and lists a few examples of what level of misbehaviour the different tiers might be issued for.

### TIER 1 - Friendly Discussion 

A discussion is initialized when:

* Revealing low-impact staff only information
* Publicly criticizing BTE
* low impact misbehaviour (“dead chat” etc.)
* Withholding non-critical information

The results of receiving a tier 1 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question with the goal to discuss the situation and potential problems it might have caused and find a good future solution.

### TIER 2 - Minor Strike

A tier 2 strike is usually given out when:

* Going on uncalled for rants
* Intentionally escalating conflicts
* Withholding important information

The results of receiving a tier 2 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question (see above)
* Issuing of a tier 2 strike to the person or people in question

### TIER 3 - Major Strike

A tier 3 strike is usually given out when:

* Revealing sensitive and/or critical staff-only information
* Toxic behavior

The results of receiving a tier 3 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question
* Issuing a tier 3 strike to the person or people in question

### TIER 4 - Removal from Staff

A tier 4 strike is usually given out when:

* Going against the decisions made by a person’s team or manager
* Undermining the work of the staff
* Leaving staff without informing the responsible people

The results of a tier 4 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question
* Issuing a tier 4 strike to the person or people in question
* Kicking the person or people in question from the staff server (potentially) allowing them to return only after a period of 6 months has passed
* The person or people in question become ineligible for the “Former Staff” role permanently

### TIER 5 - Removal from BTE

A tier 5 strike is usually given out when:

* Revealing information that can damage BTE as a brand or project and/or can damage BTE’s infrastructure
* Repeated toxic behavior
* Revealing any personal information of any BTE staff member without their consent

The results of a tier 5 strike are:

* Immediate removal from the staff and all BTE related servers without the option of a discussion
* Issuing a tier 5 strike to the person or people in question
* The person or people in question will be allowed to return to the main server after 6 months have passed and will be allowed to return to the staff once an additional 6 months have passed, totaling to 1 year





As a general rule 2 infractions of a tier will result in the next higher tier. Exceptions are: 

* Tier 1 discussions are meant to encourage improvement and self reflection. Multiple discussions do not automatically lead to strikes.
* Tier 5 removal from BTE; This is a special case scenario that only happens if rules are blatantly broken.

Depending on the infraction any of the tiers can be issued (there is no rule that says that you have to get a minor strike before you can get a major strike. If the infraction is serious enough you can be removed from staff without having any previous infractions.)

### Appeal and Expiry

Strikes and removals can be appealed by writing the responsible admin directly or using the appeals email (appeals@buildtheearth.net). Strikes have expiry dates (by default 6 months) but will be logged permanently (visible only to admins) so they will be considered when evaluating repeated misbehaviour. When a strike expires it is reduced to the tier below which will expire after the same expiry time. E.g. If you got a major strike that expires after 4 months you will then have a minor strike for additional 4 months afterwards.

Strikes can be completely removed if either 

* The situation was completely misunderstood
* The strike was issued to the wrong person
* All parties agree that no strike was warranted in some other way



## More detailed explanation of the tiers

Each tier is numbered from the lowest (1) to the highest (5).

### Tier 1: Friendly Discussion

If a minor problem or problematic behaviour occurs we will just discuss it with you. The goal here is to exchange views on the situation and what affects the behaviour or situation caused in order to prevent it from happening again. The discussion is rather informal.\
This discussion can be initiated and hosted by a Manager or Admin.\
Discussions should only be held under four eyes in a private conversation. These discussions are not logged or recorded; they stay between the two members.\
Some guidelines that these discussions should follow:

* All critique should be matter of factly and related/impacting to BTE
* You must be given the opportunity to give your perspective on the situation
* Critic should be based on observations and not on rumors or hearsay
* The discussion should be solution focussed

An example of how the discussion might look like:\
1. Short but positive start to the conversation\
2. The Manager names the topic and the observed behaviour and briefly describes what problems were caused

3. You get the chance to explain your view on the situation, the Manager listens and asks questions to better understand the situation from your perspective.

4. You discuss what caused the behaviour together

5. You discuss the problems that were caused together

6. You discuss what should be done to prevent this from happening in the future together

7. You discuss how the Manager or other team structures might help together\
8. You agree on future behaviours in similar situations

9. You find a good positive ending for the conversation

#### For Managers/Admins

##### Before you start make sure you know the following:

* What has happened? (Do not rely on hearsay or rumors. Check, observe and evaluate.)
* What is the Staff members part in this situation?
* Are other Staff members involved and what are their parts?
* Do you yourself have a part in this situation? Are you involved? Did you do the right things to prevent the situation?
* Did something like that happen before? What happened in the past?

##### During the discussion:

* Use active listening, ask questions. It should be the Staff member that does most of the talking
* Talk about facts and observations. Do not criticise character
* Use specific questions to encourage looking at the situation from a different perspective
* Ask for the reasons of the behaviour
* Encourage the Staff member to think about the effects of their behaviour themselves
* Encourage the Staff member to come up with their own solutions
* Ask what help they need from you or others
* Explain in what way you will check that the agreed upon measurements are being met
* Use clear words and take a clear position while using an appropriate tone
* Repeated misbehaviour must be met with consequences
* Encourage self-control and self-management
* Do not forget about positive sides and achievements

##### After the discussion:

* Reflect on the discussion and think about what went well and what did not go well
* If you feel very motivated write down some important points to keep in mind about the situation (conflict log)
