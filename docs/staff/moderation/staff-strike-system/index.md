# Staff Strike System

This description is increasing in level of detail. If you just want to get a brief overview check you can just read the first chapter. The following chapters are increasingly specific.

## Brief overview

We have a fine grained system for different levels of staff infractions. The following list gives an approximate idea what the different tiers are and lists a few examples of what level of misbehaviour the different tiers might be issued for.

### TIER 1 - Friendly Discussion 

A discussion is initialized when:

* Revealing low-impact staff only information
* Publicly criticizing BTE
* low impact misbehaviour (“dead chat” etc.)
* Withholding non-critical information

The results of receiving a tier 1 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question with the goal to discuss the situation and potential problems it might have caused and find a good future solution.
