# Staff Strike System

This description is increasing in level of detail. If you just want to get a brief overview check you can just read the first chapter. The following chapters are increasingly specific.

## Brief overview

We have a fine grained system for different levels of staff infractions. The following list gives an approximate idea what the different tiers are and lists a few examples of what level of misbehaviour the different tiers might be issued for.

### TIER 1 - Friendly Discussion 

A discussion is initialized when:

* Revealing low-impact staff only information
* Publicly criticizing BTE
* low impact misbehaviour (“dead chat” etc.)
* Withholding non-critical information

The results of receiving a tier 1 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question with the goal to discuss the situation and potential problems it might have caused and find a good future solution.

### TIER 2 - Minor Strike

A tier 2 strike is usually given out when:

* Going on uncalled for rants
* Intentionally escalating conflicts
* Withholding important information

The results of receiving a tier 2 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question (see above)
* Issuing of a tier 2 strike to the person or people in question

### TIER 3 - Major Strike

A tier 3 strike is usually given out when:

* Revealing sensitive and/or critical staff-only information
* Toxic behavior

The results of receiving a tier 3 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question
* Issuing a tier 3 strike to the person or people in question

### TIER 4 - Removal from Staff

A tier 4 strike is usually given out when:

* Going against the decisions made by a person’s team or manager
* Undermining the work of the staff
* Leaving staff without informing the responsible people

The results of a tier 4 strike are:

* Discussion with the person or people in question
* Issuing a tier 4 strike to the person or people in question
* Kicking the person or people in question from the staff server (potentially) allowing them to return only after a period of 6 months has passed
* The person or people in question become ineligible for the “Former Staff” role permanently

### TIER 5 - Removal from BTE

A tier 5 strike is usually given out when:

* Revealing information that can damage BTE as a brand or project and/or can damage BTE’s infrastructure
* Repeated toxic behavior
* Revealing any personal information of any BTE staff member without their consent

The results of a tier 5 strike are:

* Immediate removal from the staff and all BTE related servers without the option of a discussion
* Issuing a tier 5 strike to the person or people in question
* The person or people in question will be allowed to return to the main server after 6 months have passed and will be allowed to return to the staff once an additional 6 months have passed, totaling to 1 year

As a general rule 2 infractions of a tier will result in the next higher tier. Exceptions are: 

* Tier 1 discussions are meant to encourage improvement and self reflection. Multiple discussions do not automatically lead to strikes.
* Tier 5 removal from BTE; This is a special case scenario that only happens if rules are blatantly broken.

Depending on the infraction any of the tiers can be issued (there is no rule that says that you have to get a minor strike before you can get a major strike. If the infraction is serious enough you can be removed from staff without having any previous infractions.)

### Appeal and Expiry

Strikes and removals can be appealed by writing the responsible admin directly or using the appeals email (appeals@buildtheearth.net). Strikes have expiry dates (by default 6 months) but will be logged permanently (visible only to admins) so they will be considered when evaluating repeated misbehaviour. When a strike expires it is reduced to the tier below which will expire after the same expiry time. E.g. If you got a major strike that expires after 4 months you will then have a minor strike for additional 4 months afterwards.

Strikes can be completely removed if either 

* The situation was completely misunderstood
* The strike was issued to the wrong person
* All parties agree that no strike was warranted in some other way

## More detailed explanation of the tiers

Each tier is numbered from the lowest (1) to the highest (5).

### Tier 1: Friendly Discussion

If a minor problem or problematic behaviour occurs we will just discuss it with you. The goal here is to exchange views on the situation and what affects the behaviour or situation caused in order to prevent it from happening again. The discussion is rather informal.\
This discussion can be initiated and hosted by a Manager or Admin.\
Discussions should only be held under four eyes in a private conversation. These discussions are not logged or recorded; they stay between the two members.\
Some guidelines that these discussions should follow:

* All critique should be matter of factly and related/impacting to BTE
* You must be given the opportunity to give your perspective on the situation
* Critic should be based on observations and not on rumors or hearsay
* The discussion should be solution focussed

An example of how the discussion might look like:

1. Short but positive start to the conversation
2. The Manager names the topic and the observed behaviour and briefly describes what problems were caused
3. You get the chance to explain your view on the situation, the Manager listens and asks questions to better understand the situation from your perspective.
4. You discuss what caused the behaviour together
5. You discuss the problems that were caused together
6. You discuss what should be done to prevent this from happening in the future together
7. You discuss how the Manager or other team structures might help together
8. You agree on future behaviours in similar situations
9. You find a good positive ending for the conversation

##### For Managers/Admins

**Before you start make sure you know the following:**

* What has happened? (Do not rely on hearsay or rumors. Check, observe and evaluate.)
* What is the Staff members part in this situation?
* Are other Staff members involved and what are their parts?
* Do you yourself have a part in this situation? Are you involved? Did you do the right things to prevent the situation?
* Did something like that happen before? What happened in the past?

**During the discussion:**

* Use active listening, ask questions. It should be the Staff member that does most of the talking
* Talk about facts and observations. Do not criticise character
* Use specific questions to encourage looking at the situation from a different perspective
* Ask for the reasons of the behaviour
* Encourage the Staff member to think about the effects of their behaviour themselves
* Encourage the Staff member to come up with their own solutions
* Ask what help they need from you or others
* Explain in what way you will check that the agreed upon measurements are being met
* Use clear words and take a clear position while using an appropriate tone
* Repeated misbehaviour must be met with consequences
* Encourage self-control and self-management
* Do not forget about positive sides and achievements

**After the discussion:**

* Reflect on the discussion and think about what went well and what did not go well
* If you feel very motivated write down some important points to keep in mind about the situation (conflict log)

### Tier 2: Minor strike

### If the behaviour/ problems has larger implications a minor strike will be considered.

A minor strike is accompanied by a discussion as described above. With the following differences:

* The discussion is initiated by an Admin.
* In the beginning you will be informed that a minor strike is being considered.
* Your team manager will be at least informed that a strike is being considered.

While this conversation is still best held under four eyes you may ask a friend or member of the HR team to join as an observer.

The strike will be issued at the end of the discussion only if it is still deemed necessary strikes are issued with expiry dates and you should be informed about the expiry date

##### For Managers/Admins:

Make sure the above mentioned points are fulfilled. Discuss the situation with the Admins and optionally managers before initialising the discussion. The strike must be recorded in the #strike-log by the Admin. (See [Strike logging:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw/edit#heading=h.1p66vs6773ze)) 

### Tier 3: Major strike

If a behaviour has serious effects on the BTE project work a major strike is considered. If that is the case the decision has already been weighed among the admins and optionally the Managers.

The discussion will be slightly different:

* The Discussion is led by an Admin with a Manager or second Admin as additional point of reference/observer/witness.
* You are allowed to have a friend or member of the HR team join as observer if you wish
* You will be told that a major strike is being issued (major strikes should be well discussed among the Admins and optionally Managers before the discussion starts).
* If during it turns out during the discussion that a major strike is uncalled for you will be issued a minor strike

An example of how the discussion might look like:

1. The discussion is initialized by an Admin briefly mentioning the reason for the discussion and informing that a major strike is being considered
2. You are asked if you wish to bring another person into the discussion as an observer. The discussion is paused until everybody has arrived.
3. The admin describes the situation and explains the reasoning for considering a major strike.
4. The staff member gets the opportunity to explain the situation from their perspective.
5. The strike is officially issued
6. Discuss what can be done to prevent this behaviour in the future
7. Consequences for future similar misbehaviour are made clear (kick from the staff team)

**For Managers/Admins**

Make absolutely certain that you have a good overview over the situation. Prepare as well as possible. Be polite but decisive. Do not let the staff member take the discussion out of your hand. Be prepared that the staff member will address your pity. The strike must be recorded in the #strike-log by the Admin. (See [Strike logging:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw/edit#heading=h.1p66vs6773ze))

### Tier 4: Removal from Staff 

If the behaviour is considered to be very serious or if multiple strikes have been issued before a Staff member can be removed from Staff.

The procedure is the same as for the Tier 3 Major strike. 

Removal from staff is permanent by default (see [Return to Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw/edit#heading=h.wc99gbb90cef) for additional info) and no “former staff” role is given. The removal must be recorded in the #strike-log by the Admin. (See [Strike logging:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw/edit#heading=h.1p66vs6773ze))

### Tier 5: Removal from BTE

If a staff member breaks a rule that would be punished by a ban on the main server or a different severe infraction. They will be removed from staff and banned from the BTE main discord for the appropriate time according to the main server rules. After that they may return to the project but not to the staff team (see [Return to Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw/edit#heading=h.wc99gbb90cef) for additional info). They may appeal this ban using the appeals email address on the website.

The procedure is the same as for the Tier 3 Major strike.

The strike must be recorded in the #strike-log by the Admin. (See [Strike logging:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPlIHXve3Ksnjs4M4poSMguP7lTjXvqHLMGTmiB6gnw/edit#heading=h.1p66vs6773ze)) 

**Special case underage:** 

For underage cases, this can not be appealed, the staff member would need to create a new account when they are above the required age for Discord Terms of Service ([Discord Minimum age](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360040724612)). After that, they may reapply to staff without any restrictions.



## Strike logging

Tier 2+ infractions (minor strike, major strike, Removal from Staff, Removal from BTE) are permanently logged in a #strike-log channel visible only to the Admins. 

Information in the strike-log must not be shared with anybody. (**Exception**: Team managers may inquire < privately if an active strike exists for a specific member of their team if they have a specific reason.) 

The strike log should be updated immediately after a strike or removal has been issued with the following information:

* Name (Discord tag and common nickname if not the same) 
* devID 
* Tier of infraction
* Why the strike/removal was issued. (Short but meaningful )
* Expiry date (status)
* Admin that issued the strike

People with active strikes may not return to the staff team disregarding if they have left voluntarily (due to any reason) or where kicked.

*Currently the strike log is a simple channel which works fine for now but in the future it might change.*

## Emergency measures

In the past rash decisions have been taken in the hope to limit damage. If staff members behaved in a problematic way in the public. Not always have these emergency measures lead to a deescalation of the situation.

The first priority is to move the problem from a public stage (any channel that is accessible to a group of people that is larger than those directly involved.). 

* Ask the involved people to stop arguing in public and announce that it will be taken up internally. Ask the people that were involved to contact the appropriate people (managers/admins) in a DM (preferably someone that is currently online).
* The staff member and (optionally) others involved in the situation may be muted if the discussion persists (only after they have been told who to DM instead, otherwise people might assume we are suppressing discourse or critique).

In the case of public infractions that might lead to removal from BTE the staff member may be removed from the main server but not from the staff server without talking to the person first. (Especially if the person is currently offline e.g. in the case that rumours/hearsay boil up “over night”) The person must be informed in DM  why they were banned and that they were removed from the main server temporarily in order to clarify the situation. 

## Return to Staff

BTE is a long term project and people change a lot while growing up. We decided to keep a possibility for people to return to staff. If someone was removed from the staff team or from BTE but was allowed to return (either because the ban was temporary or because they successfully appealed the ban) they have the chance to reapply for the staff team if at least 3 trusted members of the current staff team vouch for their improved/changed character and they show that they understand the reason for their removal. The case will also be discussed among the Managers and Admins before the return is approved.

When you return you will automatically be issued a Tier 3 Major Strike for 6 months.

## Example Catalogue

Some examples of what would lead to the different tiers times this not a complete list. The intention is to create a rough frame of reference to guide decisions

*Refer to the main server rules for additional specifications.*

### Revealing Information:

* Revealing low impact staff only information (e.g. information that we kept back to surprise the community such as event information(dates, topics) or minor  upcoming updates. (1)
* Revealing medium impact staff only information (e.g. Information that impacts the work the work of a staff team or subteam e.g. undermining “hype”  that has been build towards) (2)
* Revealing strike information about others (revealing strike information within management and administration is fine, revealing strike information within the staff should require permission from the manager whose team the person who got a strike is in (or was), but revealing strike information on the main server or any BTE “related” server that isn’t the staff server should be disallowed and will warrant a tier 3 strike) (3)
* Revealing sensitive information to people who have not been cleared to view said information without the team managers or Admins permission (3)
* Revealing personal information that another staff member shared on the staff server on a different server without their permission (any personal information that doesn’t fall under the doxing rule (i.e. psychological status of a member), if it does, it’s a tier 5 strike). (4)
* Revealing information that can damage the BTE infrastructure, for example sensitive information about the network or login details to the website panel. (5)
* Revealing information that is damaging the BTE brand or future business. (5)
* Revealing sensitive personal information that another staff member shared on the staff server on a different server without their permission. (5)

### Encouraging drama and/or conflicts:

* Actively encouraging a pointless argument (a fight perhaps) within the staff server channels (1)
* Pointing out inactive channels (e.g. “dead chat”) (1)
* Unintentionally escalating conflicts (1)
* Intentionally escalating conflicts (2)
* Toxic behavior towards other staff or community members (3)
* Repeated toxic behavior and/or bullying of other staff members in the staff server (4)
* Open hostility/toxic behaviour/bullying against Staff or Community members (5)

### Hindering staff work:

* Repeated inactivity (1)
* Withholding non-critical but important information related to BTE (1)
* Withholding critical information that may be beneficial or damaging to BTE, the staff or a specific staff team (2)
* Repeatedly leaving and joining staff within 3 months with little to no explanation without negative effects to the staff team (2)
* Repeatedly leaving and joining staff within 2 months with little to no explanation with objectively negative effects to the staff team (3)
* Repeatedly and/or willfully undermining the work of a non-staff team, this applies to the Review Committee and similar non-staff teams (3)
* Repeatedly and/or willfully undermining the work of the staff or a specific staff team (4)
* Leaving staff for an extended period without explanation and without ensuring that crucial tasks and resources you control are accounted for (4)

### Publicly defaming the BTE project, the staff team, BTE as a brand or staff members:

*NOTE: We do accept criticism in a controlled environment (open discussion including the people that are involved). When it’s done improperly or in an inappropriate way that creates additional drama, like in the form of a rant in a public channel on the main server (or any other channel in any other BTE related server including the staff server) that creates unnecessary drama, it will be dealt with according to what’s listed above.*\
*You are welcome to express your opinion on any matter but remember that you are representing the whole staff team towards the community.*

*As you will notice most of the listed infractions are here to protect individual staff members from being targeted.*

* Publicly criticizing BTE or specific members of the project which reduces the public opinion of individuals or BTE in general. (1)
* Publicly blaming an individual member of the staff team for a small scale problem which leads to low level animosity towards this individual (2)
* Publicly going on a rant about smaller, non-critical decisions (2)
* Publicly blaming an individual member of the staff team for a large scale problem which leads to personal animosity against this individual. (3)
* Presenting decisions made by BTE in a very negative light in the community. (3)
* Publicly criticizing or going on a rant about BTE executive decisions in the community (larger decisions made by leads, managers and admins) (4)
* Going against the decisions made by a team collectively or by the team’s manager with negative consequences for the project (doing something without the approval of the manager that is damaging to the team’s work/performance) (4)
