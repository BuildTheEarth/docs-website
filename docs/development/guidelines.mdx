# Development Guidelines

## 0. Summary

- Naming: Variables and Functions in camelCase, Enums in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, Classes and Files using UpperCamelCase
- Descriptive Comments, with one free line above
- Sorted Imports
- Conventional Commits

## 1. Naming Conventions

### 1.1 General

When having unused variables in loops or callbacks, they should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`) to show that they are not used.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
users.forEach((user, index) => console.log(index));
```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
users.forEach((_user, index) => console.log(index));
```

:::

If there are multiple nested loops inside each other, recurring variable names should get shorter with each level of duplication.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
users.forEach((user, index) =>
  user.jobs.map((job, index2) => ({ name: job.getName() }))
);
```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
users.forEach((user, _index) =>
  user.jobs.map((job, _idx) => ({ name: job.getName() }))
);
```

:::

### 1.2 Variables and Functions

All variables should be named using camelCase for better readability. They should additionally not describe their own type in their name.

:::danger Bad

```java
ArrayList<String> SortedMessageList = handleBody();
```

:::

:::tip Good

```java
ArrayList<String> sortedMessages = handleBody();
```

:::

Variables which have already been declared and initialized but received updates should be prefixed with an identifier to show their updated state:

:::danger Bad

```java
Messages messages2 = messages.sort();
```

:::

:::tip Good

```java
Messages sortedMessages = messages.sort();
```

:::

All constants and enum contents should be named using UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for better readability. They should additionally not describe their own type in their name and should be declared to be constant.

:::danger Bad

```java
ArrayList<String> SORTED-MESSAGE-LIST;
static final int spigotProjectID;
final int SPIGOT_PROJECT_ID;
static int SPIGOT_PROJECT_ID;
public enum ExampleEnum {
    low,
    medium,
    high;
}

```

:::

:::tip Good

```java
static final int SPIGOT_PROJECT_ID = 1564233;
public enum ExampleEnum {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH;
}

```

:::

As with variables, functions should also be named using camelCase. Additionally, functions should be **prefixed **with keywords like get, update, add, to to describe their usage and possible responses.

:::danger Bad

```java
public static void helloWorld() {}
private String New_Name() {}
private int number() {}

```

:::

:::tip Good

```java
public static void sendHelloWorld() {}
private String getNewName() {}
private int toNumber() {}

```

:::

### 1.3 Classes and Files

Classes, Files and Enums should be named using UpperCamelCase for better readability. In addition, **suffixing **should be applied to group multiple classes and files together.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
class APPLICATION_CONTROLLER {
	…
}
class RandomClaim {
…
}
enum Log_Levels {
…
}


```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
class ApplicationController {
	…
}
enum LogLevel {
…
}


```

:::

### 1.4 Numbers

If possible, numbers should be **avoided **in variables, functions, enums and especially classes and file names. If required, numbers should be written as numeric characters and not as letters.
If the used programming language supports number **separators**, they should be used for numbers larger than 10.000.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 64000000;
```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 64_000_000;
```

:::

## 2. Code Formatting

### 2.1 Code Style

The opening curly brace should be placed on the same line as the control structure or function declaration.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
function calculateResult() {
  return a + b;
}
```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
function calculateResult() {
  return a + b;
}
```

:::

In all files, tabs should be used as the form of indentation. A fallback indentation with two spaces is also possible.

### 2.2 Code Comments

Code comments should be **clear **and **descriptive** and be placed on a separate line with a blank line above. The only comments that can be inline are type explanations.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
const test: string = "test";
//very clear what this does
function getTest(): string {
  return players.forEach((player) => player.kick(test)); // Good
}
```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
const test: string = "test";

// Returns a double array containing the fibonacci sequence
function getFibonnaciSequence(length: number) {}

const locData: string[]; // [street, city, country]
```

:::

### 2.3 Imports

Imports should always be **sorted**,** grouped** and **used**. Unused imports should be deleted.

:::danger Bad

```tsx
import { useForm } from "@mantine/form";
import { NextPage } from "next"; // Unused
import { IconPencil } from "@tabler/icons-react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { IconPlus } from "@tabler/icons-react";
```

:::

:::tip Good

```tsx
import { useForm } from "@mantine/form";
import { IconPlus, IconPencil } from "@tabler/icons-react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
```

:::

## 3. Best Practices

- To keep clean code, all unused imports and variables should be removed (see [2.3](#23-imports)). In addition, duplicated code should be **avoided**, if the code is being used in multiple files it should be placed inside a function in a utility class or file.
- Written code should be understandable for everyone with **clear**, **descriptive **names and code comments (see [2.2](#22-code-comments)) if needed.
- Classes should be placed in separate files to avoid large files with multiple different class exports.
- There should be no invisible or other non-latin characters present in any file. If needed Greek characters are allowed.
- Always use configuration files for dynamic and deployment specific variables, only never changing constants should be hardcoded.Two possible ways of configuration are environment files (.env) or config files in JSON or YAML.

## 4. System Design

### 4.1 Frameworks and Languages

BuildTheEarth is mainly focused on Java and JavaScript as those are two popular languages. Java is being used in all Minecraft Development projects (Plugins and Mods). All other components are written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

#### 4.1.1 Java

`// TODO`

#### 4.1.2 JavaScript

The Package Manager of choice for all JavaScript and Node.js projects is yarn ([Download](https://yarnpkg.com)), as a fallback the default node package manager should be used.

The basic project should always use **TypeScript**,** eslint** and **Prettier **as Dev-Dependencies. When using TypeScript excessive usage of the `any` type should be avoided. Type exports from third-party packages can be manipulated if the result is beneficial for the development experience or removes build errors or warnings.

### 4.2 REST APIs

url structure: plural namespace

json body

error: \{

"error": true,

"errors": [],

"message": "Not Found.",

"code": 404

}

ids always in objects

### 4.3 Minecraft Plugins

`// TODO`

### 4.4 Websites

`// TODO`

## 6. Version Control

The usage of large monorepos for multiple services of one project should be avoided, instead a single repository per service should be used.
Repositories should be named using kebab-case:

:::danger Bad

```
BuildTheEarth/NewWebsite

```

:::

:::tip Good

```
BuildTheEarth/website-frontend
BuildTheEarth/website-backend

```

The Repository has been split into two
:::

### 6.1 Commits

When committing files to Github, the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) standard should be applied to commit messages:

:::info Usage
```
<type>(<scope>): [optional emoji] <short title>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s) or breaking changes]
```

:::

Usage of emojis is optional. If you are developing in VS Code, the marketplace has a good extension with emoji support aviable.

Commits should, if possible, always be signed.

### 6.2 Actions and Workflows

When a project requires specific build steps before beeing deployed, they should happen on Github using Github Actions. Building on the Client should be avoided and only used for local testing.

## 7. Deployment

Building and Depolyment should be prepared and done on Github Actions (see [6.2](#62-actions-and-workflows)). Ideally, a docker-compose configuration should be aviable to depoly. If not, detailed instruction on how to deploy should be aviable in the `README.md`. 

## 8. Conclusion

This Development Guide should only be seen as a guide and not required. If you want to read more about programming language specific style guides, Google Opensource has some in-depth documents: [The Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) ([Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), [TypeScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html), [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html))
